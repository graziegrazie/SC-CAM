This respository was forked from [here](https://github.com/Juliachang/SC-CAM).
Some files were revised for Ubuntu 18.04 + PyTorch 1.4.0 + NumPy 1.19.4 + scipy 1.4.1.
The revised files were tested on AWS with Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04) Version 38.0.
Following sentences are not revised.

We develope a framework to generate semantic segmentation labels of images given their image-level class labels only. We propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the class activation maps by introducing a self-supervised task to discover sub-categories in an unsupervised manner. Our algorithm produces better activation maps, thereby improving the final semantic segmentation performance.

## Prerequisite
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, with Python 3.5, PyTorch 1.0.1, Torchvision 0.2.2, CUDA 9.0, and 1x NVIDIA TITAN X GPU.
* [The PASCAL VOC 2012 development kit](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/):
You need to specify the path ('voc12_root') of your downloaded dev kit.
* To extract the feature for the first round training, you need to download the pretrained weight of the [AffinityNet](https://github.com/jiwoon-ahn/psa) [[res38_cls.pth]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xESB7017zlZHqxEWuh1Rb89UhjTGIKOA/view?usp=sharing)
* To train the classification model, you need to download the pretrained weight of the [Mxnet and ResNet-38](https://github.com/itijyou/ademxapp) model [[ilsvrc-cls_rna-a1_cls1000_ep-0001.params]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YB3DkHiBeUH5wn6shk93jChvXwfOxwBE/view?usp=sharing)
* Please create a folder named weights and save pretrained models in the folder.



## Usage
### Run the whole pipeline
- We iteratively train the model with three rounds to achieve the best performance. You can directly run script.sh to complete the three-round training.
- [Note] To run the whole pipeline, you need to specify the path to the saved model for each round. Please see the command in script.sh.
```
bash script.sh
```

### Run each step
- The iteratively training process includes the step of feature extraction, sub-category label generation, and classification model training. You can use following scripts to run each step.
- [Note] Please specify the argument in the command. You can also check script.sh to see more details.

#### 1. Extract the feature from the model
```
bash python extract_feature.py --weights [your_weights_file] --infer_list ./voc12/train_aug.txt --voc12_root [your_voc12_root_folder] --save_folder [your_save_folder] --from_round_nb [round_number]
```

#### 2. Generate sub-category labels
```
bash python create_pseudo_label.py --save_folder [your_save_folder] --k_cluster 10 --for_round_nb [round_number]
```

#### 3. Train the classification model with the parent label and the sub-category label
```
bash python train_cls.py --lr 0.01 --voc12_root [your_voc12_root_folder] --weights [your_weights_file] --round_nb [round_number] --save_folder [your_save_folder]
```

### Infer the classifier and obtain the response map
- With the classification model, you can infer the classifier and generate the response map
```
bash python infer_cls.py --infer_list voc12/train.txt --voc12_root [your_voc12_root_folder] --weights [your_weights_file] --save_path [your_save_cam_folder] --save_out_cam 1 --round_nb [round_number]
```

## Refinement and segmentation network
* Refinement: We adopt the random walk method via affinity to refine the map as pixel-wise pseudo ground truths for semantic segmentation. Please refer to [the repo of AffinityNet](https://github.com/jiwoon-ahn/psa) [1].
* Segmentation network: We utilize the Deeplab-v2 framework [2] with the ResNet-101 architecture [3] as the
backbone model to train the segmentation network. Please refer to [the repo](https://github.com/kazuto1011/deeplab-pytorch).
